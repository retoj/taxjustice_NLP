Utilitarian|Utilitarian|Utilitarian|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|164|As tax relief leads to an increase in the disposable income of individuals while at the same time reducing the public budget, its nature is comparable to that of social transfers.

Rawlsian|Rawlsian|Rawlsian|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|TRUE|113|Based on this view, the principles of maximizing total utility and levying an equal tax burden on individuals both lead to the same approach: advancing a progressive tax structure.
